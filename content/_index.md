Calyx is a compiler infrastructure for languages that target hardware
accelerators.
Calyx's control language simplifies encoding of high-level semantics.
The Calyx compiler automatically optimizes and lowers programs into
synthesizable hardware designs.
Calyx has been integrated with the [CIRCT infrastructure][circt] and is available as a [dialect][calyx-circt] within it.

If you're interested in building on Calyx, please [say hello][intro] and let's chat!
